CHANGES by revision to QisJob

v4.1.1
This is an intermediate release as the Qiskit BaseBackend, BaseJob, and
BaseProvider classes have all been removed in favor of BackendV2, JobV1, and
ProviderV1. The max_credits option has also been deprecated in Qiskit and is
removed from QisJob

v4.1
Note: Version 4.1 is the last version before changing Aer simulator support to the new `AerSimulator` backend.
- Add support for IBMQ hub, group, and project (`--hub` `--group` `--project`)
- Add support for `job_monitor` kwarg `line_discipline` (`--job_monitor_line`)
- Add `--noisy_sim` for noisy simulations
- Add `--providers` to list hub/group/project providers for IBMQ
- 4 `-v`s now print QisJob data dictionary and return
- `ibmqjob_to_dict` calls on members not supported on all platforms: Now each
  call is wrapped in try/except.
- `examples/multimeasure.qasm`
- Correct version number in `setup.py`

v4.0
- Renamed module to `qisjob` from `qis_job` (Issue #3)
	- Added Makefile target `uninstall_oldname` to uninstall `qis_job`
- `qisjob.QisJob` is now fully usable class to include in your Python program.
	- Added exception regimen and removee `sys.exit()` calls (Issue #17)
	Thanks, Omar Costa Hamido! (github `omarcostahamido`)
- Add `--job_monitor_filepath`
- Use `Aer` instead of `BasicAer` (Issue #15)
- Fix bug in `-w` switch (Issue #6)
- Moved `ibmqjob_to_dict()` into `QisJob` as static method
- Better install instructions (Issue #5)
- Autogenerate docs using `pdoc3`

v3.3:
	- `--optimization_level` argument
	- QI API changed, qisjob now automatically picks a QI backend if none named
	- `BackendStatus` changed in Qiskit so changed `--status` code
	- Save result_exp as QisJob.result_exp
	- If -j then print job both before and after run
	- More verbosity info on Aer jobs (gpu)
	- Add `yiqing_5.qasm` to test QuantumInspire Starmon-5
	- Change `--qisjob_version` to `--version`
	- Change "master" branch to "main"
	- Update readme to make it clearer that qisjob can take input from stdin
	- `-w, --warnings` suppress warnings of missing optional modules

v3.2:
	- QisJob can be instanced with qasm source using `qasm_src=` a string
	- More support for Aer gpu
	- Job monitor no longer default, if desired, `--use_job_monitor`

v3.1:
	- Created Makefile
	- Check for `JobStatus.DONE` and print error if any
	- Support qiskit-jku-provider
	- Minor typos and more error handling
	- Handle Ast2CircException
	- Protect import of IBMQ Provider with try/except
	- Now reports own version with --qisjob_version
	- If `-n` then `-v -v -v` verbosity will print unrolled circuit
	- Added `no_unknown=True` so nuqasm2 will except on unparseable

v3.0:
	- Now installable with `setup.py`
	- with `-n` switch, uses nuqasm2 to assemble qasm code
	- Command once installed is `qisjob`
	- Support for new Aer GPU simulator
	- Added switches:
		`--circuit_layout`
		`--statevector_gpu`
		`--showsched`
	- Fixed bug in returning results of multiple experiment job
	- More exception catching

v2.8:
	- Main is now `qisjob` ... `qasm_job` is gone.
	- Warn, don't fail, if QuantumInspire not installed.
