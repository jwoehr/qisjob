CHANGES by revision to QisJob

v4.1.2-dev
- Use IBMProvider
- Working on Tkinter GUI in a branch
- Added `entangle.qasm` example
- Update alternate providers (e.g., JKU -> MQT)
- General code cleanups


v4.1.1
This is an intermediate release as the Qiskit BaseBackend, BaseJob, and
BaseProvider classes have all been removed in favor of BackendV2, JobV1, and
ProviderV1. The max_credits option has also been deprecated in Qiskit and is
removed from QisJob

v4.1
Note: Version 4.1 is the last version before changing Aer simulator support to the new `AerSimulator` backend.
- Add support for IBMQ hub, group, and project (`--hub` `--group` `--project`)
- Add support for `job_monitor` kwarg `line_discipline` (`--job_monitor_line`)
- Add `--noisy_sim` for noisy simulations
- Add `--providers` to list hub/group/project providers for IBMQ
- 4 `-v`s now print QisJob data dictionary and return
- `ibmqjob_to_dict` calls on members not supported on all platforms: Now each
  call is wrapped in try/except.
- `examples/multimeasure.qasm`
- Correct version number in `setup.py`

v4.0
- Renamed module to `qisjob` from `qis_job` (Issue #3)
	- Added Makefile target `uninstall_oldname` to uninstall `qis_job`
- `qisjob.QisJob` is now fully usable class to include in your Python program.
	- Added exception regimen and removee `sys.exit()` calls (Issue #17)
	Thanks, Omar Costa Hamido! (github `omarcostahamido`)
- Add `--job_monitor_filepath`
- Use `Aer` instead of `BasicAer` (Issue #15)
- Fix bug in `-w` switch (Issue #6)
- Moved `ibmqjob_to_dict()` into `QisJob` as static method
- Better install instructions (Issue #5)
- Autogenerate docs using `pdoc3`

v3.3:
	- `--optimization_level` argument
	- QI API changed, qisjob now automatically picks a QI backend if none named
	- `BackendStatus` changed in Qiskit so changed `--status` code
	- Save result_exp as QisJob.result_exp
	- If -j then print job both before and after run
	- More verbosity info on Aer jobs (gpu)
	- Add `yiqing_5.qasm` to test QuantumInspire Starmon-5
	- Change `--qisjob_version` to `--version`
	- Change "master" branch to "main"
	- Update readme to make it clearer that qisjob can take input from stdin
	- `-w, --warnings` suppress warnings of missing optional modules

v3.2:
	- QisJob can be instanced with qasm source using `qasm_src=` a string
	- More support for Aer gpu
	- Job monitor no longer default, if desired, `--use_job_monitor`

v3.1:
	- Created Makefile
	- Check for `JobStatus.DONE` and print error if any
	- Support qiskit-jku-provider
	- Minor typos and more error handling
	- Handle Ast2CircException
	- Protect import of IBMQ Provider with try/except
	- Now reports own version with --qisjob_version
	- If `-n` then `-v -v -v` verbosity will print unrolled circuit
	- Added `no_unknown=True` so nuqasm2 will except on unparseable

v3.0:
	- Now installable with `setup.py`
	- with `-n` switch, uses nuqasm2 to assemble qasm code
	- Command once installed is `qisjob`
	- Support for new Aer GPU simulator
	- Added switches:
		`--circuit_layout`
		`--statevector_gpu`
		`--showsched`
	- Fixed bug in returning results of multiple experiment job
	- More exception catching

v2.8:
	- Main is now `qisjob` ... `qasm_job` is gone.
	- Warn, don't fail, if QuantumInspire not installed.
